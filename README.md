## Bath Traffic

David Marsh 
Created: 15 December

BathHacked, with the support of BANES council, has published a rich set of traffic data from November 2017, for analysis linked to the proposed Bath Clean Air Zone.

Here I provide 2 notebooks:
* BHTransits.Rmd: Explores patterns of traffic transiting the Bath area, with a particular focus on working out how many vehicles might start using the Toll Bridge, if there is a charge for going through the city centre. THe current output is in BHTransits.nb.html.
* BHSpeed.Rmd: A quick look at average speeds along one section of the A36, through Bathampton, using data from the ANPRs at each end.

If you want to use this code you need to download that data and unzip it into a folder Data/banes_anpr_data/, after that, the code here is self-sufficient.
